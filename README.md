# Time_Series_Analysis_Housing_Price_Forecasting
The median home price in January 2000 was $163,500 in todayâ€™s dollars and then $299,400 in September 2019 (https://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/pdf/uspricemon.pdf). It shows 83% growth in almost 20 years. As the cost of housing climbs, more and more people are concerned about the trend of housing price. This inspired my interest in housing price analysis.

I conducted time series analysis on housing prices (single-family homes) in District of Columbia, California, Texas, New York, Virginia and Florida based on their popularity. In addition, I forecasted which area would have the highest investment return in the next 5 years. 

The dataset is from Zillow (https://www.zillow.com/research/data/) and it includes value for all single-family homes of different states and territories from April 1996 to December 2019.
